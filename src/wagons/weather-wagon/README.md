# The Weather Wagon - FiskevÃ¤der

## Overview
The Weather Wagon provides comprehensive fishing weather conditions for Swedish lakes, streams, and coastal waters. Built as a self-contained wagon for the B8Shield platform using only free APIs.

## Features

### Current MVP Implementation
- **Location Search**: Enter any Swedish fishing location
- **SMHI Weather Data**: Real-time weather from Swedish Met Institute (FREE)
- **Moon Phase Calculations**: Built-in lunar phase calculations
- **Fishing Score Algorithm**: AI-powered scoring based on weather conditions
- **Popular Locations**: Quick access to famous Swedish fishing spots
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices
- **Swedish Localization**: Complete Swedish interface

### Weather Data Included
- Air temperature
- Wind speed and direction
- Humidity and air pressure
- Precipitation and visibility
- Cloud coverage
- Fishing condition score (0-100)
- Moon phase and illumination

### Fishing Intelligence
- Optimal temperature ranges for fishing
- Wind condition analysis
- Barometric pressure effects
- Moon phase influence on fish behavior
- Personalized fishing recommendations
- Best fishing times of day

## API Sources (All FREE)

### Primary APIs
- **SMHI Weather API**: Swedish Meteorological Institute (FREE)
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim**: Location geocoding (FREE)
- **Built-in Moon Calculations**: No API required

### Future Expansion Ideas
- Mosquito/insect activity tracking (Swedish government APIs)
- Water temperature data (SMHI)
- Tide information for coastal fishing
- Historical weather patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Wagon System Integration
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically detected by WagonRegistry
- **Minimal Coupling**: Only 2 connections to main "train"
- **Self-Contained**: All components, utils, and hooks included
- **Removable**: Delete directory to completely remove

### File Structure
```
src/wagons/weather-wagon/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js                    # Auto-discovery entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ WeatherWagonManifest.js     # Wagon configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WeatherSearch.jsx       # Main search interface
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WeatherResults.jsx      # Results display
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ weatherAPI.js           # API integrations
```

### Routes Provided
- `/weather` - Search interface
- `/weather/results/:location` - Results display

### Navigation Integration
- Adds "FiskevÃ¤der" menu item to user navigation
- Order: 25 (after marketing materials)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Auto-Discovery Test
The wagon should be automatically discovered when the app starts. Check browser console for:
```
ðŸš‚ B8Shield Train: Discovering wagons...
ðŸ”— Connected wagon: The Weather Wagon v1.0.0
âœ… B8Shield Train: X wagons connected
```

### 2. Navigation Test
- Login to B8Shield platform
- Look for "FiskevÃ¤der" in the main navigation menu
- Click should navigate to `/weather`

### 3. Search Functionality Test
Try these popular Swedish fishing locations:
- `KultsjÃ¶n, SaxnÃ¤s, VÃ¤sterbotten`
- `VÃ¤nern, VÃ¤rmland`
- `VÃ¤ttern, JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping` 
- `Siljan, Dalarna`

### 4. API Integration Test
- Enter a location and submit
- Should show loading spinner
- Should display weather data from SMHI
- Should calculate fishing score
- Should show moon phase

### 5. Error Handling Test
- Try invalid location (should show error)
- Try location outside Sweden (may have limited data)
- Test network connectivity issues

## MVP Validation Goals

### User Experience
- [ ] Location search works intuitively
- [ ] Weather data loads within 5 seconds
- [ ] Fishing score provides valuable insights
- [ ] Mobile interface is usable
- [ ] Swedish text is natural and clear

### Technical Performance
- [ ] APIs respond reliably
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully  
- [ ] Loading states provide good UX
