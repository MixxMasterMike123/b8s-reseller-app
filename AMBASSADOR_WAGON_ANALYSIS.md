# üö® CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Ambassador Wagon Missing Intelligence Systems

## Current State Assessment

**STATUS**: Ambassador Wagon is functionally complete but lacks the sophisticated intelligence systems that make the Dining Wagon revolutionary.

**PROBLEM**: Without these systems, Ambassador Wagon is just a contact list with basic CRUD operations.

**SOLUTION NEEDED**: Port the advanced Swedish Business Intelligence systems from Dining Wagon.
