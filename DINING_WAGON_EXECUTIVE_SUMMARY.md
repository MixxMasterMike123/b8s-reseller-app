# The Dining Wagon™ - Executive Summary
## Revolutionary CRM with Swedish Business Intelligence

### 🧘‍♂️ The Core Philosophy
**"Maximum Signal, Minimum Noise, Swedish Lagom"**

Traditional CRMs create anxiety, not productivity. We built a **relationship intelligence system** based on Swedish cultural principles that respects work-life balance while maximizing business effectiveness.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve
- **Cognitive overload** from endless task lists
- **Unpredictable defer systems** that confuse users
- **No respect for work-life balance**
- **American "hustle culture"** that burns out Swedish professionals

## 🔥 Our Solution: Three Questions + ZEN Defer

### The Three Questions (Every Morning)
1. **"Vem ska jag prata med?"** (Who should I talk to?)
2. **"Vad hände senast?"** (What happened recently?)
3. **"Vad har hänt innan?"** (What happened before?)

### Swedish Business Intelligence Defer System
- **Morning defer (08:00-12:00)** → Returns after lunch
- **Afternoon defer (12:00-17:00)** → Returns tomorrow morning
- **Friday afternoon defer** → Returns Monday morning
- **Evening/night defer** → Returns tomorrow morning
