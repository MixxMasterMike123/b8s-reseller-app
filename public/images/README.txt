# Logo Placement

The B8Shield logo is now implemented in the application using the SVG file "B8Shield-Logotype 1.svg" in this folder.

The logo is displayed in the application header on both desktop and mobile views. Using SVG format ensures the logo will look crisp at any size and on any device.

If you need to update the logo in the future:
1. Replace the SVG file in this folder (keep the same filename)
2. Or update the file paths in AppLayout.jsx if using a different filename

If you need to adjust the size or positioning of the logo, you can modify the AppLayout.jsx component in src/components/layout/
