# ðŸš€ B8Shield Campaign System - Implementation Notes

## **CRITICAL TECHNICAL NOTES FOR ALL PHASES**

### **URL Structure & Language Awareness**
- **ALWAYS use `/:currentLang/` in all front-facing URLs**
- **Campaign URLs**: `shop.b8shield.com/:currentLang/?ref=AFFILIATE_CODE&campaign=CAMPAIGN_CODE`
- **QR Code Generation**: Must respect affiliate's `preferredLang` setting
- **Future Landing Pages**: `shop.b8shield.com/:currentLang/campaign/CAMPAIGN_CODE/?ref=AFFILIATE_CODE`

### **Translation System**
- **Use ContentTranslations** (like Products system)
- **All campaign fields** must be multilingual: name, description, rules, etc.
- **File**: `src/hooks/useContentTranslation.js` for translation logic
- **Pattern**: `getContentValue(content, currentLanguage)` and `setContentValue(content, language, value)`

### **Social Media Platform Sizes** (Phase 1)
```javascript
const CAMPAIGN_BANNER_SIZES = {
  instagram_post: { width: 1080, height: 1080, name: 'Instagram Post' },
  instagram_story: { width: 1080, height: 1920, name: 'Instagram Story' },
  tiktok_video: { width: 1080, height: 1920, name: 'TikTok Video' },
  twitter_post: { width: 1200, height: 675, name: 'X (Twitter) Post' },
  youtube_thumbnail: { width: 1280, height: 720, name: 'YouTube Thumbnail' },
  facebook_post: { width: 1200, height: 630, name: 'Facebook Post' },
  linkedin_post: { width: 1200, height: 627, name: 'LinkedIn Post' }
};
```

### **Lottery System Logic**
- **Each product SKU = 1 ticket** in lottery draw
- **Multiple SKUs in order = multiple tickets**
- **OPTIONAL feature** for admins to enable per campaign
- **Winner selection**: Random draw from all participants weighted by ticket count

### **Database Collections**
```
campaigns/                    # Main campaign data
campaignParticipants/        # Lottery entries & tracking  
campaignBanners/            # Social media assets
campaignAnalytics/          # Performance data
```

### **Future Features to Consider**
- **Affiliate Tiers/Categories**: OFF by default, enable when 100+ affiliates
- **Approval Process**: Not needed initially, add when needed
- **Landing Pages**: URLs already structured for future implementation
