## ðŸ”„ Alternative: Use Public Sheets Without API Key

If you can't get an API key, we can modify the approach:

1. Make your Google Sheets public (Anyone on the internet can view)
2. Use a different API endpoint that doesn't require authentication
3. This is less secure but works for testing

Let me know which approach you prefer!
